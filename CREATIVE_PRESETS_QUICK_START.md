## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Preset doesn't seem to affect output**
**Solution:** Check console logs - you should see:
```
🎨 CREATIVE DIRECTION
   Preset: Premium Minimal (premium-minimal)
   Inspiration: Apple, Tesla, Airbnb
```

### **Issue: Colors still wrong**
**Solution:** This is a Gemini model limitation. Presets improve quality but don't 100% guarantee color accuracy. The enhanced prompts with preset guidance should significantly improve it though.

### **Issue: No visual differences between presets**
**Solution:** Generate a larger batch (10-20 ads) to see clear preset differences. With only 2 ads, variations might be subtle.
