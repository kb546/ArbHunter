## ArbHunter — Simple Pitch Deck (copy/paste into Word)

### 1) One‑liner
**ArbHunter helps performance teams find profitable GEO + topic opportunities, generate high‑quality A/B creatives fast, and organize everything into campaigns — without spreadsheets.**

---

### 2) The problem (what media buyers face today)
Ad arbitrage is simple in theory: buy cheap traffic → monetize with higher RPM.
In practice, teams lose money because:
- They test the wrong countries/topics.
- Creative quality is inconsistent (bad CTR kills the test before it starts).
- Results and learnings aren’t organized (winners get lost, “random testing” repeats).

---

### 3) What ArbHunter does (in plain English)
ArbHunter is a focused workflow for ad arbitrage testing:
1) **Discovery**: pick a market + topic and get a quick “worth testing?” signal.
2) **Creative Studio**: generate 2 variations for A/B testing (or batch options).
3) **Campaigns**: save outputs, mark winners, tag variations, export copy.

You get from “idea” → “test” → “organized results” in minutes.

---

### 4) Why it’s different
**Not another “AI generator.”** ArbHunter is built specifically for arbitrage workflows:
- **Market-first thinking** (GEO + intent topics)
- **Always A/B** (2 variations by default)
- **Quality checks + brand-aware prompting**
- **Campaign organization** (so you can scale what works)

---

### 5) Who it’s for (ideal users)
- Media buyers running search arbitrage / RSOC / Facebook-to-AdSense style tests
- Small teams testing multiple markets weekly
- Agencies managing multiple niches and clients

---

### 6) Example outcomes (what success looks like)
- Faster testing: more shots on goal per week
- Cleaner creative: better early CTR → better signal quality
- Better organization: winners, notes, and exports live in one place

---
